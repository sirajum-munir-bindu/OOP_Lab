1. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
•	Objective: Practice basic mathematical operations and user input.
•	Problem: Write a Java program to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula:
Celsius=(Fahrenheit−32)×59\text{Celsius} = (\text{Fahrenheit} - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}Celsius=(Fahrenheit−32)×95

2. Simple Interest Calculator
•	Objective: Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
•	Problem: Write a Java program to calculate simple interest using the formula:
SI=P×R×T100\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}SI=100P×R×T
where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

3. Check Leap Year
•	Objective: Use conditional statements.
•	Problem: Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year.

4. Sum of Digits
•	Objective: Practice loops and digit manipulation.
•	Problem: Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number.

 5. Factorial of a Number
•	Objective: Use loops for repetitive calculations.
•	Problem: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
6. Prime Number Checker
•	Objective: Use loops and conditional statements.
•	Problem: Write a program to check whether a given number is prime.


7. Fibonacci Sequence
•	Objective: Practice loops and sequence generation.
•	Problem: Write a program to display the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
8. Palindrome Checker
•	Objective: Use loops and string manipulation.
•	Problem: Write a program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

9. Armstrong Number Checker
•	Objective: Use loops and digit manipulation.
•	Problem: Write a program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (e.g., 153 = 13+53+331^3 + 5^3 + 3^313+53+33).
10. Grade Calculator
•	Objective: Practice conditional statements and user input.
•	Problem: Write a program to take a student's marks as input and display the corresponding grade based on the following scale:
o	Marks >= 90: Grade A
o	Marks >= 80: Grade B
o	Marks >= 70: Grade C
o	Marks >= 60: Grade D
o	Marks < 60: Grade F
